# Hi there, I'm Facundo! ðŸ–³

### Computer Science student, Game and App developer

I'm a person that enjoys facing new and challenging projects, in order to learn something new.
I've developed a videogame in 2016, and another one in 2017. I've also published and android app in 2021.  

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on a Javascript library which, with the use of Aframe.js and Handsfree.js, users will be able to grab objects floating around you with just your hands.  

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning React Native and Crypto.
